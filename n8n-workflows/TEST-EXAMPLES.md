## üîç How to Debug

### View n8n Execution Logs

1. Open n8n: `http://localhost:5678`
2. Click **"Executions"** in left sidebar
3. Click on any execution to see:
   - Input data (screenshot URL, tone, platform)
   - Each node's output
   - Errors (if any)
   - Response time

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Image not recognized"**
- Check image URL is publicly accessible
- Ensure base64 has `data:image/png;base64,` prefix
- Try a smaller image (<5MB)

**Issue: "Replies are generic"**
- Make sure screenshot shows clear conversation text
- Try a different tone
- Check if image URL loads in browser

**Issue: "Slow response (>10 seconds)"**
- OpenAI Vision API can be slow for large images
- Resize images to 1024x1024 max
- Check your internet connection
